    <div class="paragraph"><p>Kirinyaga University (KyU) is located approximately 115 Km North East of Nairobi on Sagana - Embu - Highway. It is the successor to Kirinyaga Technical Institute which was conceived by the people of Kirinyaga way back in 1971 when the former head of state His Excellency the President, Hon. Daniel Arap Moi C.G.H., M.P. (then Vice-president) launched the Harambee Fund Raising Drive at the request of Kirinyaga people. Kirinyaga County Council set aside 200 acres of land for the institute at Kutus and 50 more acres were also acquired at Kangaita area on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The Institute opened doors to the first students on 2nd March 1977 when 72 students were enrolled, 48 of these students were admitted in the building and construction department while the remaining 24 were enrolled in the clothing and textile technology department. New training <a href="Assets/Programmes.pdf" target="_blank">Programmes</a> were introduced in plumbing and Electrical installation in the early and mid-eighties respectively. <br><br>Kirinyaga University College the predecessor to KyU was established as a constituent college of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and technology (JKUAT) through a Legal Order No. 108 of August 2011.
